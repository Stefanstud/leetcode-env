You are given two **0-indexed** integerpermutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return *the **prefix common array** of* `A` *and* `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called aÂ **permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.
