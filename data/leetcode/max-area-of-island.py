"""
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s
(representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.)
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the
island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in _`grid`. If there is no island,
return `0`.
