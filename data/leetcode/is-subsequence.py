Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_`s` _is a **subsequence** of
_`t` _, or_`false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a
subsequence of `" _a_ b _c_ d _e_ "` while `"aec"` is not).
