"""
You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

Let us call a **non-empty** subset of rows **good** if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.

More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is `k`, then the sum of each column should be at most `floor(k / 2)`.

Return *an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in **ascending** order.*

If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.

A **subset** of rows of the matrix `grid` is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from `grid`.
