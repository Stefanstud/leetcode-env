"""
There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

* At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.
* Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.

Return *the number of **colored cells** at the end of* `n` *minutes*.
