"""
Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string,
return _the sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2` _as a string_.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling
large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to
integers directly.
