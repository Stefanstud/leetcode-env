You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same
level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following
definition:

    
    
    struct Node {
      int val;
      Node *left;
      Node *right;
      Node *next;
    }
    

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.
