"""
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return _the shortest string that has
both_`str1` _and_`str2` _as **subsequences**_. If there are multiple valid
strings, return **any** of them.

A string `s` is a **subsequence** of string `t` if deleting some number of
characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`.
