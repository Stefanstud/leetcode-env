"""
Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in
non-decreasing order_** , find two numbers such that they add up to a specific
`target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and
`numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_`index1` _and_`index2` _, **added by
one** as an integer array _`[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may
not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
