You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If
that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return
`-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
