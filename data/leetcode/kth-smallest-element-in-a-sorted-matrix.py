"""
Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns is sorted in
ascending order, return _the_ `kth` _smallest element in the matrix_.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element **in the sorted order** , not the
`kth` **distinct** element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than `O(n2)`.
