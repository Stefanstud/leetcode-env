"""
There are some prizes on the **X-axis**. You are given an integer array `prizePositions` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, where `prizePositions[i]` is the position of the `ith` prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer `k`.

You are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be `k`. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.

* For example if `k = 2`, you can choose segments `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and you will win any prize i that satisfies `1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3` or `2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4`.

Return *the **maximum** number of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally*.
